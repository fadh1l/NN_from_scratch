# Building a Neural Network from Scratch

## Overview

A neural network consists of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, also known as perceptrons. The network takes input data, passes it through the layers, and produces an output. The key steps involved in building a neural network are as follows:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the input data by normalizing, scaling, or encoding it to make it suitable for training.

2. **Initialization**: Initialize the weights and biases of the neurons in the network. Random initialization is commonly used to avoid symmetry.

3. **Forward Propagation**: Perform forward propagation to pass the input data through the layers. Each neuron applies an activation function to the weighted sum of its inputs and produces an output.

4. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the loss or error between the predicted output and the actual output. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE) and cross-entropy loss.

5. **Backpropagation**: Perform backpropagation to calculate the gradients of the weights and biases. The gradients indicate the direction and magnitude of the changes required to minimize the loss.

6. **Parameter Update**: Update the weights and biases using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. The update is performed in the opposite direction of the gradients to minimize the loss.

7. **Repeat**: Iterate through steps 3 to 6 (forward propagation, loss calculation, backpropagation, and parameter update) for multiple epochs or until the model converges.

8. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, it can be used for making predictions on new, unseen data. Forward propagation is performed on the trained model to generate the output.


- **Understanding the Inner Workings**: By implementing each component manually, you gain a deeper understanding of how the neural network functions at a fundamental level.

- **Flexibility and Customization**: Building from scratch allows you to customize every aspect of the network, from the architecture to the activation functions and optimization algorithms.

- **Learning Experience**: Building a neural network from scratch is an excellent learning experience that helps solidify your understanding of concepts like forward propagation, backpropagation, and parameter updates.
